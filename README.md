Group Chat App with Python Socket, Threading, and SSL
This is a simple group chat application built using Python, sockets, threading, and SSL encryption. The application allows multiple users to connect to a common chat room using a room number and exchange messages securely.

Features
Secure SSL encrypted communication.
Multi-user group chat.
Room-based communication using room numbers.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Basic understanding of Python socket programming and threading.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/group-chat-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd group-chat-app
Install the required dependencies (if any):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate SSL certificates (for testing purposes):

bash
Copy code
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
Run multiple client instances:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Each client instance will prompt you to enter a room number. Enter the same room number for all clients that you want to connect to the same chat room.

Start chatting with other users in the same room!

Usage Notes
The server runs on the default port 5050. If you want to use a different port, you can modify the server.py file.

The SSL certificates provided here are self-signed and meant for testing purposes. In a production environment, you should use valid SSL certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.

The communication protocol uses a simple text-based format. You can extend this project to support more advanced features such as file sharing, emojis, or user authentication.

Use Ctrl+C to gracefully exit the server and client instances.
